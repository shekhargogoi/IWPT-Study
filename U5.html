        <h3>Introduction to Server-Side Scripting language</h3>
        <p>
          Server-side scripting is a technique used in website designing to create
          dynamic web pages based on various conditions when the user’s (client’s)
          browser makes a request to the server The Web Server executes the
          server-side scripting which produces the page to be sent to the browser.
          The server executes server-side scripts to forward a page however it
          doesn’t execute client-side scripts.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Server-side scripting is often used to connect with the databases that
          locate on the web server. Also, it can approach the file system lying at
          the web server. It is generally observed that response from a
          server-side script is slower when compared to a client-side script as
          the scripts are prepared on the seclude computer. PHP, Python, Ruby are
          some common examples of server-side scripting.

			<h3>ASP has two different meanings in the IT world: </h3>
      <br />

      <ol>
        <li>Application Service Provider</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          An Application Service Provider is a company or organization that
          provides software applications to customers over the Internet. These
          Internet-based applications are also known as "software as a service"
          (SaaS) and are often made available on a subscription basis. This
          means ASP clients often pay a monthly fee to use the software, rather
          than purchasing a traditional software license. Some SaaS applications
          can be accessed via a web browser, while others operate over a
          proprietary secure port.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>Active Server Page.</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          An Active Server Page, commonly called an "ASP page," is a webpage
          that may contain scripts as well as standard HTML. The scripts are
          processed by an ASP interpreter on the web server each time the page
          is accessed by a visitor. Since the content of an ASP page can be
          generated on-the-fly, ASP pages are commonly used for creating dynamic
          websites.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ASP is similar to other scripting platforms, like PHP and JSP, but
          supports multiple programming languages. While the default ASP
          language is VBScript, ASP pages can include other programming
          languages as well, such as C# and JavaScript. However, alternative
          languages must be defined before the script code using the following
          declaration:
        </p>
        <p><%@ Page Language="C#"%></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ASP pages are part of the ASP.NET web application framework developed
          by Microsoft. Therefore, ASP pages are most often found on
          Windows-based web servers that run Microsoft Internet Information
          Services, or IIS. You can tell if you are accessing an ASP page in
          your browser if the URL has an ".asp" or ".aspx" suffix.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>File extensions: .ASP, .ASPX</p>

      <h3>Java Server Pages</h3>
			<ul>
        <li>It stands for Java Server Pages.</li>
        <li>It is a server side technology.</li>
        <li>It is used for creating web application.</li>
        <li>It is used to create dynamic web content.</li>
        <li>In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages.</li>
        <li>It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology.</li>
        <li>
          It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform
          independent web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          JSP is first converted into servlet by JSP container before processing
          the client’s request.

      <h4>Features of JSP</h4>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coding in JSP is easy :- As it is just adding JAVA code to HTML/XML.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduction in the length of Code :- In JSP we use action tags, custom
          tags etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connection to Database is easier :-It is easier to connect website to
          database and allows to read or write data easily to the database.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make Interactive websites :- In this we can create dynamic web pages
          which helps user to interact in real time environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Portable, Powerful, flexible and easy to maintain :- as these are
          browser and server independent.
        </li>
        <li>
          No Redeployment and No Re-Compilation :- It is dynamic, secure and
          platform independent so no need to re-compilation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extension to Servlet :- as it has all features of servlets, implicit
          objects and custom tags

      <h3>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</h3>
      <p>
        The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a
        server-side scripting language designed specifically for web
        development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and
        use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension
        “.php”.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participating in
        the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not
        require a compiler.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>PHP code is executed in the server.</li>
        <li>
          It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL
          Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Informix.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and
          can be used to control user access.
        </li>
        <li>
          It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP,
          and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded
          in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like
          HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are
          directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the
          server and then the result is returned to the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only information that the client or browser knows is the result
          returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the
          actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support
          other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.
        </li>
