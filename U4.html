        <h3>Introduction to Client-Side Scripting language</h3>
        <p>
            Client-side Scripting is utilized when the client’s (user’s) browser has
            all the code and the page is modified on the basis of the client’s
            (user’s) information. The Web Browser executes the client-side scripting
            that locates within the user’s computer. Client-side scripts are also
            known as the embedded script (as they are often embedded within an HTML
            or XHTML document).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The browser gets the page sent by the server & executes the client-side
            scripts. Client-side scripting can’t be utilized to join with the
            databases on the web server. Client-side scripting cannot get the file
            system which lies at the web server.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The records and settings which are local at the client’s (user’s)
            computer can be approached employing Client-side scripting language.
            It’s generally observed the response from a client-side script is faster
            when compared to a server-side scripting language as the scripts are
            prepared on the local computers. JavaScript, VB scripts are some common
            examples of client-side scripting.

<p>
    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
    implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
    more than just sit there and display static information for you to look
    at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
    graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Advantages of JavaScript</p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      Speed. Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run
      immediately within the client-side browser. Unless outside resources
      are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend
      server.
    </li>

    <li>
      Simplicity. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.
    </li>
    <li>Popularity. JavaScript is used everywhere on the web.</li>
    <li>
      Interoperability. JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can
      be used in a huge variety of applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      Server Load. Being client-side reduces the demand on the website
      server.
    </li>
    <li>Gives the ability to create rich interfaces.</li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>Basic rules of JavaScript</p>
  <br />
  <p>The following rules apply to the basic syntax of JavaScript:</p>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript is case-sensitive.</li>
    <li>Statements should end in a semicolon (;).</li>
    <li>
      Variables:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Must be defined before being used. The variable name can contain A
          – Z, a – z, underscore or digits and must start with a letter or
          an underscore (“_”).
        </li>
        <li>
          Assume the type of the data that is put into the variable. The
          data type does not have to be explicitly defined
        </li>
        <li>
          Are global variables when defined outside of a function, and are
          available anywhere in the current script context. Variables
          created within a function are local variables, and can be used
          only within that function.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Strings have to be enclosed in quotation marks, either a single or
      double. For example: print(”Hello ” + ‘world ‘+ Country.name) produces
      the following: Hello world US.
    </li>
    <li>
      Special characters that are displayed literally must be preceded by a
      backslash character (\). Quotes within a string can be entered
      preceded by a backslash as well.
    </li>
    <li>
      To increment a variable, such as a = a + 1, you can use a++. You can
      decrement a variable in the same way, as in a--.
    </li>
    <li>
      To enter comments in the script, use "//" to start a single line
      comment or the combination of "/*" and "*/" to enclose a multi-line
      comment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Values that are not defined as a data type (string, number, Boolean)
      may be defined as an object, such as Date, Array, Boolean, String, and
      Number. As an example you could define: var ArrayList=new
      Array(”test”, ” this”, ” list”);.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dots in Service Manager field names must be replaced by an underscore
      (_) in JavaScript. For example contact.name becomes contact_name.
    </li>
    <li>
      Service Manager field names that are reserved words in JavaScript have
      to be preceded by an underscore, such as “_class” for the “class”
      field.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Event handling using JavaScript</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    When an event occurs, you can create an event handler which is a piece
    of code that will execute to respond to that event. An event handler is
    also known as an event listener. It listens to the event and responds
    accordingly to the event fires.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    An event listener is a function with an explicit name if it is resuable
    or an anonymous function in case it is used one time.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    An event can be handled by one or multiple event handlers. If an event
    has multiple event handlers, all the event handlers will be executed
    when the event is fired.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>There are three ways to assign event handlers.</p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>HTML event handler attributes</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Event handlers typically have names that begin with on, for example,
        the event handler for the click event is onclick.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To assign an event handler to an event associated with an HTML
        element, you can use an HTML attribute with the name of the event
        handler. For example, to execute some code when a button is clicked,
        you use the following:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        < input type="button" value="Save" onclick=" alert ('Clicked!')" >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this case, when the button is clicked, the alert box is shown.
      </p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p>DOM Level 0 event handlers</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Each element has event handler properties such as onclick. To assign
        an event handler, you set the property to a function as shown in the
        example:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>let btn = document . querySelector('# btn');</p>

      <p>btn . onclick = function() {</p>
      <p>alert('Clicked!');</p>
      <p>};</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this case, the anonymous function becomes the method of the
        button element. Therefore, the this value is equivalent to the
        element. And you can access the element’s properties inside the
        event handler:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>let btn = document.querySelector('#btn');</p>

      <p>btn.onclick = function() {</p>
      <p>alert(this.id);</p>
      <p>};</p>
      <br />
      <p>Output:</p>

      <p>btn</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By using the this value inside the event handler, you can access the
        element’s properties and methods.
      </p>

    </li>
    <br>

    <li>DOM Level 2 event handlers</li>
    <br>
<p>DOM Level 2 Event Handlers provide two main methods for dealing with the registering/deregistering event listeners:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
addEventListener() – register an event handler

</li>
<br>
<p>The addEventListener() method</p>
<br>
<p>The addEventListener() method accepts three arguments: an event name, an event handler function, and a Boolean value that instructs the method to call the event handler during the capture phase (true) or during the bubble phase (false). For example:</p>
<br>

<p>let btn = document.querySelector('#btn');</p>
<p>btn.addEventListener('click',function(event) {</p>
<p> alert(event.type); // click</p>
<p>});</p>

<br>
<li>
removeEventListener() – remove an event handler
</li>
<br>
<p>The removeEventListener() method</p>
<br>
<p>The removeEventListener() removes an event listener that was added via the addEventListener(). However, you need to pass the same arguments as were passed to the addEventListener(). For example:</p>
<br>
<p>let btn = document.querySelector('#btn');</p>


<p>let showAlert = function() {</p>
<p>alert('Clicked!');</p>
<p>};</p>
<p>btn.addEventListener('click', showAlert);</p>


<p>btn.removeEventListener('click', showAlert);
</p>
</ol>
<br>


    </li>


  </ol>

<u><h2>Ajax and VB Script</h2></u>
<h4 >What is AJAX?</h4>
      <p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.</p>
      <br />
      <p>AJAX is not a programming language.</p>
      <br />
      <p>AJAX just uses a combination of:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web
          server)
        </li>

        <li>JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data
        with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to
        update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
      </p>

        <li>
          An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is
          clicked)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript</li>
        <br />
        <li>The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server</li>
        <br />
        <li>The server processes the request</li>
        <br />
        <li>The server sends a response back to the web page</li>
        <br />
        <li>The response is read by JavaScript</li>
        <br />
        <li>Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript</li>

      <h3 >VB Script</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        VBScript ("Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition") is an Active
        Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual
        Basic. It allows Microsoft Windows system administrators to generate
        powerful tools for managing computers with error handling, subroutines,
        and other advanced programming constructs. It can give the user complete
        control over many aspects of their computing environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        VBScript uses the Component Object Model to access elements of the
        environment within which it is running; for example, the
        FileSystemObject (FSO) is used to create, read, update and delete files.
        VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of
        Microsoft Windows since Windows 98;in Windows Server since Windows NT
        4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device
        it is installed on).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A VBScript script must be executed within a host environment, of which
        there are several provided with Microsoft Windows, including: Windows
        Script Host (WSH), Internet Explorer (IE), and Internet Information
        Services (IIS). Additionally, the VBScript hosting environment is
        embeddable in other programs, through technologies such as the Microsoft
        Script Control (msscript.ocx).
